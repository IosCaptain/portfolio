    <h1>Abel Gonzalez</h1>
    <p>
    Born and raised in Cuba, Abel came to the US at the age of 18. His original plan was to get his Green Card, go back to his friends in Cuba and finish college over there.
    But then he realized he could easly make money and not have to worry about walking 2 miles for milk and eggs every day for breakfast. So he desided to stay and instead drive to Walmart for eggs and milk. 
    After some time he realized that eggs and milk was not enough to make him happy so he is now looking for things that release seratonin in his brain. He would advise to follow him on social media but he barely uses it.
